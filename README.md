status (on going)

### HOW /  Demonstration 


I use a simple example like a calculator with features such as sum and multiplication

One branch using module Pattern (old way / oldCalc) without module loader

second branch using module loader browser and with simple functions 

third branch using module loader Browser and Class way (using es2015 Class syntax sugar)
