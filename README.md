### HOW /  Demonstration


I use a simple example like a calculator with features such as sum and multiplication

Master branch - use as template or start kit with few files

first branch ( oldCalc) - using module Pattern (old way / oldCalc) without module loader

second branch (newCalc) - using module loader browser and with simple functions and es2015+ syntax ( import / export)

third branch (calcClass) - using module loader Browser and Class way (using es2015 Class syntax sugar)

-> Clone one of Branches

-> Open a terminal ( on MacOS or Linux) or CommandLine / PowerShell ( on Windows)
